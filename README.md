Connects NOVA to WordPress so your SEO automation can update pages and layouts the standard API cannot reach.

## Description

NOVA Bridge Suite is the WordPress companion plugin for NOVA, your AI SEO automation. It opens safe, controlled paths so NOVA can update content and layout elements that are normally locked behind page builders or WordPress internals.

Use it to automatically:

- Update content and layouts in popular page builders.
- Push SEO metadata and custom fields alongside page updates.
- Manage multilingual updates with WPML and Polylang.
- Add rich text below WooCommerce category listings.
- Enable NOVA Blog and Service Page custom post types.
And much more.

Modules are optional and can be toggled from `Settings -> NOVA Settings`. The core bridge and post resolver are always on; other modules only run when enabled and when the related plugin is active.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to `wp-content/plugins/` or install the ZIP in `Plugins -> Add New`.
2. Activate `NOVA Bridge Suite`.
3. Go to `Settings -> NOVA Settings` and enable the modules you need.
4. Connect NOVA to your site using WordPress application passwords or another REST authentication method.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need an active NOVA subscription to use this plugin?

This plugin is designed for NOVA. You can activate it without NOVA, but NOVA is the only system trained to use this plugin.

### Will this replace my page builder?

No. It works alongside builders like Avada, Elementor, WPBakery, and more. NOVA can update their content safely.

### Does it work on WooCommerce sites?

Yes, NOVA can navigate WooCommerce products and categories. If WooCommerce is active you can also enable the optional rich text field module for category pages - in case your category page template still needs this.

## Changelog

### 2.3.11

- Let Blog CPT text, links, and CTA buttons inherit site styling by default, with optional per-CPT color overrides in the settings UI.
- Move existing posts to the renamed Blog CPT slug during settings saves and remap CPT-specific design and layout overrides to the new slug.
- Use the active CPT label in empty archive messages instead of the old hardcoded fallback copy.
- Mark the release metadata as tested through WordPress 6.9 so 6.9.4 sites report compatibility correctly.

### 2.3.10

- Make the Blog CPT table of contents expand to full width when key takeaways are empty instead of leaving the takeaways column blank.
- Keep the existing two-column TOC and key takeaways layout when both panels are populated.

### 2.3.9

- Fix deprecated `mb_convert_encoding(..., 'HTML-ENTITIES', ...)` handling in the Blog CPT DOM parsing flow for public post renders.
- Switch blog heading annotation and H1 stripping to numeric-entity encoding so PHP 8.2+ no longer emits deprecation notices.

### 2.3.8

- Improve Elementor full-document persistence so verified `_elementor_data` replacements are applied live instead of silently falling back to stale content.
- Correct Elementor JSON decoding to read stored and incoming document payloads raw-first, with unslashed fallback only for legacy escaped inputs.
- Return hard failures for invalid `elementor_data` payloads and persisted document mismatches instead of reporting a false success.
- Support `elementor_page_settings` during document saves and keep Elementor runtime meta aligned after persistence.
- Strengthen Elementor cache invalidation and post-cache refresh during publish-side document updates.

### 2.3.7

- Improve WPML taxonomy translation stability for multilingual WooCommerce category updates.
- Normalize WPML language handling during term writes and add diagnostics for translation state debugging.
- Refresh Yoast term indexables and multilingual caches after translated taxonomy updates to keep SEO output consistent.
- Harden duplicate-slug recovery and REST/meta synchronization for translated product categories.

### 2.3.6

- NOVA Gutenberg Bridge: improved merge logic, permissions, and dedup.
- Relax GET permissions to read-only for API consumers and GPT actions.
- Add author field support on create/update endpoints.
- Strip source images, media-only containers, and custom widget blocks during merge.
- Handle cover/hero blocks by replacing headings with the page title and stripping source text.
- Improve dedup with global paragraph dedup and better heading-section collapse.
- Rebuild innerContent null-slot mapping when blocks are removed.
- Add debug logging to the merge flow.
